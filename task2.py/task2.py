Team 2 task is to implement the state machine simulation logic.
This involves creating the Python functions or classes that will simulate the behavior of a state machine. 

1. Understand the State Machine Structure:
A state machine consists of states, inputs, and transitions between states based on inputs.States represent conditions or configurations.
Inputs trigger transitions from one state to another.Transitions define the relationship between current states, inputs, and the next states.

2. Class Design for the State Machine:
Create a class StateMachine to encapsulate the simulation.This class will have attributes for:
Current state A dictionary of transitions where keys are current states and values are dictionaries of input-action-next state tuples.
Methods to process inputs and transition to new states.
    
3. Implementation Outline:

class StateMachine:
    def _init_(self, states, transitions, initial_state):
        """
        Initialize the state machine with possible states, transitions, and initial state.
        
        states: list of all possible states
        transitions: dictionary of transitions, e.g., 
                     { 'state1': {'input1': 'state2', 'input2': 'state3'}, ... }
        initial_state: the state from which the machine starts
        """
        self.states = states
        self.transitions = transitions
        self.current_state = initial_state

    def transition(self, input_value):
        """
        Handle an input and move to the next state based on the current state and input.
        """
        if input_value in self.transitions[self.current_state]:
            next_state = self.transitions[self.current_state][input_value]
            print(f"Transitioning from {self.current_state} to {next_state} on input {input_value}")
            self.current_state = next_state
        else:
            print(f"No transition found for input {input_value} in state {self.current_state}")

    def get_current_state(self):
        """
        Return the current state of the machine.
        """
        return self.current_state
